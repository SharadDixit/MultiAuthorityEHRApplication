The patient was tested for Myalgia on the left elbow. Blood tests were conducted to detect inflammation and to rule out underlying conditions. These included a complete blood count (CBC), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), electrolytes, hormone levels, calcium, phosphate, serum enzymes levels, and serological tests. Physical tests included gait, posture, and coordination for any abnormal movements. Muscles were inspected for any evidence of wasting (atrophy), enlargement (hypertrophy) or permanent shortening (contracture). Muscle tone (natural tension) and strength were assessed through range-of-motion and resistance exercises.
